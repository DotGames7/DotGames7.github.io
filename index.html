<h1>DotGames</h1>
<p>Nothing really interesting here. DotGames is the name behind which a single person develops games as a hobby. <br>

I have absolutely no idea why you'd come here but anyway if you want to contact me, feel free to send me a mail <a href="mailto:julienprissi@gmail.com">right here</a></p>

<h3>Have you heard of ?</h3>
<p><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotGames.Kube'>Kube</a>, a small puzzle game made in Unity available on the Google Play Store</p>
<p><a href='https://dotgames.itch.io/helicavecopter'>HeliCaveCopter</a> (what a lame name), some Unity flappy-bird style game available on itch.io</p>
<h3>What next ?</h3>
<p>I should definitely start blogging this summer as a way to improve my english and have fun researching interesting topics (maybe what I'm learning, researching or experimenting, who knows ?)</p>
<p>I should also spend some time building some real games (I mean something that isn't all about the gameplay, something much more deep, that tends toward what I consider to be a 'real' game). This could be fun.</p>
